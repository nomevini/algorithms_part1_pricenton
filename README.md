# 📘 Algorithms, Part I — Princeton University (Coursera)

This repository contains my **materials, notes, code, and solutions** for the *Algorithms, Part I* course offered by **Princeton University** on **Coursera**.

The course focuses on **fundamental algorithms and data structures** with Java implementations and performance analysis.

## 📚 Course Overview

*Algorithms, Part I* introduces essential concepts in algorithms and data structures, including:

- **Elementary data structures** (e.g., stacks, queues)
- **Sorting and searching algorithms**
- **Union–find and other fundamental techniques**
- Java programming with a focus on performance and scientific analysis

The course typically includes **video lectures, programming assignments, and exercises** that build understanding through both theory and implementation.
